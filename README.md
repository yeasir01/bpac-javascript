# Brother QL Series Printer SDK for Web Browsers

## Introduction
Welcome to the Brother QL Series Printer SDK for Web Browsers! This project aims to provide a modern and well-documented JavaScript SDK for seamless communication between web browsers and Brother QL series label printers.

## Purpose
The original Brother SDK lacked documentation and was written in JScript, making it challenging for developers to work with. This project seeks to address this issue by providing clear documentation, enabling better code understanding and integration with IntelliSense.

## Features

* Modern JavaScript: The SDK has been refactored to use modern JavaScript practices, making it more accessible for developers familiar with contemporary web development.

* Documentation: Comprehensive documentation has been added to the codebase, ensuring that developers have clear insights into the functionality and usage of each module.

* IntelliSense Support: With well-documented code and consistent naming conventions, developers can enjoy improved IntelliSense support for a smoother coding experience.
